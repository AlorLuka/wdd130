    <h2>Alor Luka</h2>
    <p>Hello there. My name is Alor Luka. Half the people I know call me Alor, the other half call me Luka - you can call me either or Batman, whichever you're comfortable with.</p>
    <p>I'm almost  25 years old and not yet so sure what my career path is. All I know is that someday I would like to be in the field of business development. I came to the realisation that there are so many amazing businesses out there solving real world problems but their lack of knowledge regarding how to put themselves deprives the world of their amazing services or products.</p>
    <p>I'm a language enthusiast who doesn't speak that many languages - yet. I so far speak Arabic, English and Dinka (a language native to South Sudan) I also do love playing video games and basketball for sport.</p>
    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is the hands on learning experiences I receive. Not only that but the seamless integration of spiritual and temporal life which provides me with more confidence in life because whenever God is involved, through his grace we can prosper in all our endavours. I am currently pursing a degree in Software Development</p>
